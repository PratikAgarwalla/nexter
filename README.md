# Nexter üè†üåü

**Nexter** is a premium website where users can discover and purchase luxury properties and beautiful villas while connecting with top realtors. Developed during my web development learning journey, Nexter is a testament to the skills and techniques I've acquired, particularly in grid layout and responsive web design.

- **Responsive Web Design:** Ensuring that Trillo looks great on any device, from mobile to desktop.

This project is inspired by the exceptional teaching of Jonas Schmedtmann, whose courses have been instrumental in my growth as a web developer.
